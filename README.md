ACCIDENT LOCATIONS ON INDIAN ROADS

India ranks first in the world for the number of accidents and lives lost on the roads. The country has only 1% of vehicles worldwide but has 11% of accidents worldwide. The Ministry of Road Transport (MoRTH) uses the concept of a Blackspot to mark these locations to improve road safety on national highways in the country. Moreover, States and local authorities also maintain a similar list of accident locations on road networks â€“ typically with location names.

Road accident prediction is a significant area of research in traffic safety. Several factors influence the likelihood of road traffic accidents, including the geometric characteristics of the road, traffic flow patterns, weather conditions, time of occurrence, driver characteristics, and the overall road environment.

The exponential growth of vehicles and accidents poses a pressing concern for road safety. It is imperative to take decisive measures to effectively address this issue in our country. Although various solutions exist, their proper implementation has been lacking thus far.

The findings of this project highlight the urgent need to address road safety concerns in Bangalore and implement effective measures to reduce accidents and ensure the well-being of road users.
Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial visualization techniques in understanding and addressing road safety challenges. It sets the foundation for evidence-based interventions, improved traffic planning, and ultimately a safer environment for all road users in Bangalore.

The project in the future can make a significant impact on improving road safety, reducing accidents, and saving lives. It has the potential to become a valuable resource for decision-makers, researchers, and the community at large. By fostering a culture of safety and contributing to a sustainable transportation system in India, this project can drive positive change for road users nationwide.
