ACCIDENT LOCATIONS ON INDIAN ROADS

India ranks first in the world for the number of accidents and lives lost on the roads. The country has only 1% of the vehicles in the world but has 11% of the accidents in the world. Ministry of Road Transport (MoRTH) uses the concept of a Blackspot https://morth.nic.in/black-spot to mark these locations to improve road safety on national highways in the country.
